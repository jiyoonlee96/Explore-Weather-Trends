# Explore-Weather-Trends
This is the first project of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data trends. I compared San Francisco (local) temperature trends to overall global temperature trends between 1849 and 2019.

## Steps

* Step 1: Extract the data from the database with a SQL query
* Step 2: Create a line chart of local and global temperature trends (moving averages)
* Step 3: Make observations about overall temperature trend and the similarities and differences between global and local temperature trends

## Tools Used

* SQL
* Python
